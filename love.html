this might seem a bit unusual compared to the handwritten ones that I have sent you, I'm sorry I couldn't give you anything this month for our monthsary but instead of just sitting and saying oh sorry I don't have anything for you today, I made this letter for you.

I know we've been having some rough days and slow ones too but I'd rather have those than not having you at all. I love you with all my heart babyy and I'll continue to do so as long as I breath(so corny but yes). I hope the coming months will be more nicer to us, no more of those stuff testing your patience for some reason on some random days and I hope you continue to love me despite it all. 

I love you so much baby, I can't wait to go back and cuddle all day long with you. Happy Monthsary babyy MWAAMWAAA!!!
